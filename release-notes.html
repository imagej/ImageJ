<li> <u>1.50f 22 December 2015</u>
<ul>
<li> Added the <i>Analyze&gt;Tools&gt;Grid</i> command, which
creates a non-destructive grid of lines, crosses, circles or points on the current image.
<li> Thanks to Michael Elbaum, added the <i>Process&gt;FFT&gt;Make Circular Selection</i>
command.
<li> Thanks to Daniel Chung, text images can now be opened by dragging and dropping
them on the "&gt;&gt;" icon in the toolbar.
<li> Thanks to Stein Rorvik, with spatially calibrated images, when there is a selection and
the cursor is inside the selection, the location and size of the selection is displayed in
the status bar in pixels when either the alt or shift keys are pressed.
<li> Thanks to Norbert Vischer, added the Stack.setOrthoViews(x,y,z), 
Stack.getOrthoViewsID() and Stack.stopOrthoViews() macro functions
(<a href="macros/OrthogonalViewsDemo.txt">example</a>).
<li> Thanks to Stein Rorvik, added the getInfo("macro.filepath") macro function.
<li> Thanks to Norbert Vischer, <i>Image&gt;Stacks&gt;Orthoganal Views</i>
is faster and more reliable when working with hyperstacks.
<li> The getInfo(key) macro function returns "Invalid key" if a value
associated with the key is not found.
<li> Thanks to Gabriel Landini, added the ImageProcessor.drawLine4(x1,y1,x2,y2)
method, which draws 4-connected lines.
<li> Added the static RoiManager.getRoiManager() method, which returns a
reference to the ROI Manager and opens the "ROI Manager" window if
it is not already open.
<li> Thanks to Nicolas Stifani, fixed bugs that could cause the 
getResultLabel(row) and getResultString("Label",row) macro functions to fail.
<li> Thanks to MartinH, fixed a bug that caused montages created using
<i>Image&gt;Stacks&gt;Make Montage</i> to lose their pixel dimensions.
<li> Thanks to Norbert Vischer, fixed a bug that caused the Pixel 
Inspector tool to not work correctly with blank 32-bit images.
<li> Thanks Kees Straatman, fixed a bug that caused <i>Process&gt;Find Maxima</i>,
with "Count" output, to sometimes display unwanted results.
<li> Thanks to Romain Guiet, fixed a bug in the ROI Manager that caused it
to ignore an ROI name if the name was 9 character in length and it had a "-" 
in the middle.
<li> Thanks to Stein Rorvik,  fixed a bug that caused macros run from the command
line to fail if the argument contained parenthesis.
<li> Fixed a 1.50c regression that caused the deprecated RoiManager.getROIs() 
method to return null.
</ul>
