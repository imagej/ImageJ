<li> Thanks to Neil Fazel, fixed a bug that caused error bars added using the
Plot.add() macro function to not appear if the data points were added using Plot.add()
(<a href="macros/examples/ErrorBars2.txt">example</a>).
<li> Thanks to Marc Lartaud and Michael Schmid, fixed a bug that caused
Feret's diameter of selections created with the selection brush tool on spatially
calibrated images to be given pixels.
