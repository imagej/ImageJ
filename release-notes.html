<li> Single macro tools are now installed in the first available toolbar slot, or
if no slots are free, they are installed in the last slot.
<li> Added the ij.plugin.tool.PlugInTool class, which was inspired by
Johannes Schindelin's AbstractTool class in Fiji

methods to the ImagePlus class.

macro function to sometimes not work as expected.

that duplicated or opened images.
<li> Thanks to Paul Jurczak, fixed a bug that cause some RGB BMP files to fail to open.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused the makeText() macro function

correctly handle overlays.
