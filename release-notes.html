<li>
<li> Thanks to Dimiter Prodanov, added duplicate(), crop() and convertToFloat() 
methods to the ImageStack class.
<li> Thanks to Michael Doube, fixed a bug that caused plugins in jar files with
a plugins.config entry starting or ending in one or more spaces to not be
installed correctly.
<li> Thanks to Jason Rogers, fixed a bug that caused the
<i>Edit&gt;Copy</i> command in the "Results" window to
not work with one line tables.
<li> Thanks to Vytas Bindokas, fixed a bug that sometimes caused
3D filters in <i>Process&gt;Filters</i> to throw exceptions.
<li> Thanks to Fabrice Cordelieres, fixed a 1.47v regression that sometimes caused
unexpected results from setting the "plugins.dir" Java property.
<li> Thanks to Norbert Vischer, fixed a bug that caused some commands in
