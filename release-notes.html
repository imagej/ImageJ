<li> <u>1.46e 5 January 2012</u>
<ul>
<li> Changes made to options in the <i>Edit&gt;Options&gt;Appearance</i>
dialog box cause the current image to be immediately updated.
<li> Upgraded the <i>Image&gt;Stacks&gt;Tools&gt;Concatenate</i> plugin
to the version from the MacBiophotonics distribution and Fiji written
by Jon Jackson.
<li> Less memory is required to display float images.
<li> Thanks to Michel Julier, images zoomed less than 100%
are displayed with higher quality.
<li> Thanks to Martin Dressler, fixed bugs in 
<i>Image&gt;Duplicate</i> and <i>Image&gt;Stacks&gt;Tools&gt;Make Substack</i>
that caused image "Info" metadata to be discarded.
<li> Thanks to Johannes Schindelin, fixed a 1.46a regression that could cause 
plugins that extended the PolygonRoi class, did spline fitting and accessed the  
protected xp and yp arrays to fail.
</ul>
