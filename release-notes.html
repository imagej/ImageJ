<li> <u>1.51b 31 May 2016</u>
<ul>
<li> Thanks to Gabriel Landini, when duplicating a single slice of a stack
using <i>Image&gt;Duplicate</i>, the title of the resulting 
image is derived from the slice label if the slice has one.
<li> Added the <i>Help&gt;Examples&gt;JavaScript&gt;Gamma Adjuster</i>
example script, which demonstrates how to interactively update an image 
that has been added to a GenericDialog.
<li> Thanks to Ralph Albuquerque, the "Add to overlay" option  
in <i>Analyze&gt;Set Measurements</i> now causes the
overlay elements to be labeled by default.
<li> Thanks to Curtis Rueden, replaced the Command Finder tooltips, which
could cause an exception, with a "Help" button.
<li> Thanks to Alex Doe, the GenericDialog.repaint() method now
repaints images that have been added to the dialog
(<a href="macros/js/DialogImageDemo.js">example</a>).
<li> Thanks to Joe Pickard, the backspace (delete) key is ignored in 
the Gel Analyzer to prevent inadvertent erasure of the contents of
the selection rectangle.
<li> Added the ImagePlus.getRawStatistics(), ImageStatistics.getStatistics(ip)
and ImageProcessor.getHistogram(nbins) methods.
<li> Thanks to Jerome Mutterer, fixed a bug that caused Roi change listeners
to not be notified when a line's width was adjusted and a bug that caused
<i>Analyze&gt;Measure</i> to report incorrect values for 'min' and 'max'
when "Limit to threshold" was enabled and 'area' was zero.
<li> Fixed a bug that made it impossible to unset "Show labels"
in the <i>Image&gt;Overlay&gt;Labels</i> dialog box
if "Use names as labels" was enabled.
<li> Thanks to Jerome Mutterer, fixed a bug that caused 
the Roi.getContainedPoints() macro function and
Roi.getContainedFloatPoints() method to throw
exceptions with rectangular selections.
<li> Thanks to Ezemiron, fixed a bug that caused the
<i>Image&gt;Scale</i> command to throw an exception
when processing a stack with an overlay.
<li> Thanks to Curtis Rueden, fixed bugs that caused
<i>Image&gt;Overlay&gt;Add Image</i> to not set
the stack position and <i>Image&gt;Scale</i> to
not correctly scale ImageRois in overlays.
<li> Thanks to Robert Haase, fixed a bug that caused the
<i>Edit&gt;Selection&gt;Create Selection</i> command to
throw an exception on Java 8 if there were no thresholded pixels.
<li> Thanks to Ondrej Sebesta, fixed a bug that caused the
<i>File&gt;Open Next</i> command to sometimes incorrectly
 preserve the isHyperstack flag.
