<li> <u>1.51q 18 September 2017</u>
<ul>
<li> Plot enhancements, thanks to Michael Schmid:
<ul>
  <li> Plots saved as tiff or zip include the data, so the plot range can be modified (zooming, etc.)
  and the data can be listed after loading the plot from a file.
  <li> Changing the axis or label font size of a plot keeps the image size constant
  and modifies the plot frame size (previously, the plot frame size was constant).
  <li> Slightly more space for numbers at the left, enough for scientific notation. ImageJ switches
  to a smaller font if more significant digits are required.
  <li> Added Plot.getFrameBounds(x, y, width, height) macro function.
  <li> The default font for plots is now Arial, not Helvetica (Arial is available on more platforms).
  <li> When opening a plot on a computer where a given font is not available,
  try to replace fonts by similar ones. This should make the appearance on
  different platforms more similar.
  <li> The ImageProcessor getStringWidth() and getStringBounds() methods
  use the more accurate GlyphVector class.
</ul>
<li> Thanks to Norbert Vischer, the <i>Edit&gt;Selection&gt;Straighten</i>
and <i>Image&gt;Duplicate</i> commands work
with rotated rectangle selections.
<li> Thanks to Jerome Parent, added the
<i>Image&gt;Stacks&gt;Plot XY Profile</i> command.
<li> Thanks to Jerome Parent, added a "Show unit" checkbox to the
<i>Analyze&gt;Tools&gt;Calibration Bar</i> dialog box.
<li> Thanks to Stein Rorvik, newly opened editor windows are larger and,
on Linux and Windows, are less likely to cover the main ImageJ window.
<li> Thanks to Norbert Vischer, added a "Smooth if thresholded"
option to the Wand tool dialog
(<a href="macros/examples/SmoothLetters.txt">example</a>).
<li> Thanks to Kenneth Sloan, added a recordable ZProjector.run() method
(<a href="macros/js/ProjectionDemo.js">examples</a>).
<li> Thanks to Norbert Vischer, added the makeRotatedRectangle(x1,y1,x2,y2,width)
macro function.
<li> Thanks to Norbert Vischer, added the List.toArrays(keys,values),
List.fromArrays(keys,values) and List.indexOf(key) macro functions.
<li> Thanks to Max Leiter, fixed a bug that caused RoiListeners to not be
notified when an ROI was created.
<li> Thanks to Alvaro Folgado, fixed an OS X command injection 
vulnerability in the  BrowserLauncher.
<li> Thanks to Alison Walter, fixed a bug that caused the "Spline fit"
checkbox in the "Line Width" dialog to convert angle selections to polygons.
<li> Thanks to Chris Lamb, fixed a typo in MemoryMonitor.java where a
constant that should have been 1024 was 1204.
<li> Thanks to Norbert Vischer, fixed a bug in the Array.resample() macro
function that caused it to throw an exception if the langth of the input
was 0 or 1.
<li> Thanks to John Loveland and Lukas Kvasnica, fixed a v1.51o
regression that caused plugins that create virtual stacks without
implementing the VirtualStack class to throw an exception.
<li> Thanks to Tim Huang, fixed a bug that caused the <i>Image&gt;Overlay&gt;Flatten</i> 
command to not work correctly with high-resolution images.
<li> Thanks to Norbert Vischer, fixed a bug with the <i>Debug&gt;Abort</i> command in
the macro editor that caused it to display a bogus error message.
<li> Thanks to Stefan Helfrich and Azman Rashid, fixed a bug that caused ImageJ
to not correctly read TIFF files created by the Bfconvert command line tool.
<li> Thanks to Jan Eglinger, fixed a bug that caused the popup menu
(e.g. right-click &gt; Rename...) and the "Dev" menu tool to not get recorded.
<li> Thanks to Sethur, fixed a bug that caused scroll wheel zooming 
in image stacks (enabled using control or shift key) to not work correctly.
<li> Thanks to Steffen Schmidt, fixed a bug that caused scale bars
to not be correctly positioned with large font sizes.
<li> Thanks to Vanessa King and Jan Eglinger, fixed a bug that caused the
"List" option in plot windows to sometimes not list all X columns when
the columns differed in length.
<li> Thanks to Carne Draug, fixed several problems related to building
the ImageJ Debian package.
<li> Thanks to Salim Kanoun, fixed a bug that caused overlay titles 
to be selectable when a new ROI was being constructed.
<li> Thanks to Norbert Vischer, fixed a bug than caused the
<i>Analyze&gt;Gels&gt;Select Next Lane</i> command
to sometimes create duplicate plots.
<li> Thanks to Michael Kaul, fixed a v1.51o regression that caused the
 ImagePlus.flatten() method to be much slower.
 <li> Fixed a 1.51e regression  that caused the "Auto" buttion in the 
 <i>Brightness/Contrast</i> dialog to not increase contrast with repeated clicks.
