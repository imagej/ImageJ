<li> <u>1.51e 5 August 2016</u>
<ul>
<li> Added a "Don't set Mac menu bar" option to the
<i>Edit&gt;Option&gt;Misc</i> dialog. When this option
is set, ImageJ does not set the ImageJ menu bar when
image windows are activated.
This may prevent ImageJ from becoming unresponsive due to setMenuBar()
becoming slower and slower over time. To recover the menu bar, click on
the "ImageJ" window or press return, the shortcut for the
Window>Main Window command.
<li> When running Java 8 on OS X, the "Don't set Mac menu bar" option
in <i>Edit&gt;Option&gt;Misc</i> is automatically set when it the
setMenuBar() method takes more than two seconds.
<li> Thanks to Gabriel Landini, when selecting rectangular ROI handles, the
buffer zone is larger on screens wider than 1280 pixels.
<li> Thanks to Patrick Darby Parker, plot windows created by macros 
calling run("Plot Z-axis Profile") now include a "Live" button.
<li> Thanks to Philippe Carl, the <i>Plugins&gt;Compile and Run</i> command
adds jar files in the plugins/jars folder with "_" in their names to the javac classpath.
<li> Added the ImagePlus.crop() method
(<a href="macros/js/Duplication_Demo.js">example</a>).
<li> Thanks to Jean-Yves Tineves, added the VirtualStack(width,height,slices)
constructor that creates a virtual stack with no backing store
(<a href="macros/js/NoBackingStoreVirtualStack.js">example</a>).
<li> Thanks to Ignacio Garcia Gonzalez, fixed a bug that caused ROIs with
coordinates greater 65535 to be corrupted when saved and reopened.
<li> Thanks to Jens Kriese, fixed a bug that caused the slices of 
new "Random" stacks to be copies of the first slice.
<li> Thanks to Ondrej Sebesta, fixed a bug that caused the roiManager("Select",index)
macro function to fail if setKeyDown("Shift") was previously called.
<li> Thanks to Marcel, fixed a bug that caused the "Propagate to all open images" option
in the "Set" dialog of the <i>Image&gt;Adjust&gt;Window/Level</i> widget to fail.
<li> Thanks to Philippe Carl, fixed a bug that caused the
<i>Image&gt;Stacks&gt;Tools&gt;Concatenate</i> command
to not be correctly recorded when the Recorder was not in "Macro" mode.
<li> Thanks to Jan Eglinger, fixed a bug that caused the
<i>Image&gt;Color&gt;Channels Tool</i> widget to not work
as expected in "Color" mode when using Java 8 on Mac OS X.
<li> Thanks to Steve, fixed a bug in the <i>Image&gt;Stacks&gt;Make Montage</i>
command that caused it to not work as expected if "Border width"
was greater than 0.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, fixed a bug that caused the ImageCanvas.setSourceRect()
method to sometimes modify the Rectangle passed to it.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, fixed a bug that caused the ImageJ menu bar
on Mac OS X to disappear when cliking on the "B&C" window to activate it.
<li> Thanks to Stefan Helfrich, fixed a bug that caused inconsistent handling
of the animation rate if it was set to less than 0.1 fps.
<li> Thanks to Stefan Helfrich, fixed a bug that caused the
<i>Image&gt;Stacks&gt;Label</i> command to not work as
expected with hyperstacks if the "Use overlay" option was enabled.
<li> Thanks to Gabriel Landini, fixed a v1.51d regression that caused the 
ImagePlus.getStatistics() method to be much slower.
<li> Thanks to Jean-Yves Tineves, fixed a v1.47 regression that caused
overlays to not work with custom virtual stacks.
<li> Thanks to jbrazill and Jan Eglinger, fixed a regression that caused the
<i>Image&gt;Overlay&gt;Flatten</i> command to not
work with non-RGB images without a selection or overlay.
