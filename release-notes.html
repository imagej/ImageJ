to the <i>Edit&gt;Options&gt;Input/Output</i> dialog box.
<li> Thanks to Norbert Vischer, the information shown in the <i>Help&gt;About ImageJ</i>
window is displayed in a text window when you press "i" (<i>Image&gt;Show Info</i> and
is therefore easily copied to the clipboard.

macro editor's <i>Macros&gt;Function Finder</i> command.

to the Roi class and Roi.getProperty(), Roi.setProperty() and Roi.getProperties() macro functions

<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, fixed a bug in <i>Process&gt;Noise&gt;Salt and Pepper</i> that
caused it to omit the last column and row of the image.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, fixed bugs in the macro interpreter that caused expressions in
the form s+"abc", where 's' is a string variable, to cause macros to abort when used
as a function argument or used in a 'return' statement.
<li> Thanks to Patrick Page-McCaw, fixed a bug that sometimes caused the particle
analyser, when run from a plugin, to display a "No particles were detected..." dialog.

Circularity fields in the particle analyzer dialog box were blank.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused the wand tool to not be correctly recorded
