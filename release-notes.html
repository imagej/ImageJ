<li> Thanks to Nicolas Cedilnik and Mark Hiner, fixed a bug that could cause an

<li> Thanks to Kees Straatman, fixed a bug that caused the ROI Manager's "Multi Measure"
command to sometimes not work as expected when the "append" option was used.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused the "Decimal Places" field in the <i>Analyze&gt;Set Measurements</i>
dialog to be ignored after the value was set to zero.
<li> Thanks to Stein Rorvik, fixed a 1.50d regression that caused duplicated images
to lose their density calibration.
