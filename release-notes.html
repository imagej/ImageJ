<ul>
<li> Thanks to Dimiter Proanov, <i>Image&gt;Stacks&gt;Plot Z-axis Profile</i>
now displays the plot in calibrated units.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, added a <i>File&gt;Revert</i>
command to the text editor.

the <i>Edit&gt;Balance</i> command, which locates the pair of curly 
braces or parentheses that surround the insertion point.
<li> Thanks to Norbert Vischer, the editor's <i>Edit&gt;Balance</i> 
command works with files containing '{' and '}' characters in comments.

GaussianBlur.blurGaussian() method to throw an exception
if the image had an ROI.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, fixed a bug that could cause the
BackgroundSubtracter#rollingBallBackground() method to throw an
exception when called with a FloatProcessor.
<li> Thanks to Carn&euml; Draug and Johannes Schindelin, fixed a bug that 
caused the File.directory  macro function to not return the expected
value after calling open(path).

macro files without extensions from the command line.
