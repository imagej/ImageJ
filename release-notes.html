<li> <u>1.51h 26 September 2016</u>
<ul>
<li> Thanks to Avital Steinberg, fixed a bug that caused the
ImageProcessor.getStatistics() method to sometimes not work
as expected with ShapeRois.
<li> Thanks to Gilles Carpentier, fixed a 1.50i regression that caused
the <i>Edit&gt;Selection&gt;Enlarge</i> command to sometimes not
work as expected when shrinking very small selections.
</ul>
