<li> <u>1.51o 26 May 2017</u>
<ul>
<li> Added a <i>Command Finder</i> tool to the <i>&gt;&gt;</i> toolbar menu.
<li> Updated the VirtualStack class to support frequency domain FFT images
(<a href="macros/examples/StackFFT.txt">example macros</a>).
<li> Worked around bugs with Windows 10 Creators Update that caused the
file open dialog to freeze and the "ImageJ" window to be taller than normal.
<li> Thanks to Wilhelm Burger and Tiago Ferreira, fixed a bug that caused
coordinates used by the ImageProcessor.getLine() method to retrieve
pixel values to be offset by 0.5 pixel when interpolation was not enabled.
<li> Thanks to Wilhelm Burger, fixed a bug that caused the ImageProcessor.setColor()
method to ignore RGB component weights when setting the associated
drawing (i.e., gray) value of non-RGB grayscale images.
<li> Thanks to Robert Atwood, fixed a bug that caused the "Auto" option
in the <i>Image&gt;Adjust&gt;Threshold</i> tool to sometimes not work as
expected with 16-bit stacks.
<li>Thanks to Christian Tischer, fixed a bug that caused the 
<i>Image&gt;Transform&gt;Bin</i> command to change the 
calibation of the source image.
<li> Thanks to Theresa Swayne, fixed a bug that caused the ROI Manager's
Multi-Measure command (in "append" mode) to not reset its saved results
when the Results Table was cleared.
<li> Thanks to Rob Beetel, fixed a regression that caused the ROI to be
deleted after using "Apply" on RGB images in the <i>Brightness/Contrast</i>,
<i>Window/Level</i> and <i>Color Balance</i> dialogs.
