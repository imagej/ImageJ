<li> <u>1.46f 2 February 2012</u>
<ul>
<li> Thanks to Denny Hugg, ImageJ will replace the standard crosshair cursor
with a custom cursor if there is a GIF image named "crosshair-cursor.gif" in the ImageJ/images
folder. There is an example custom cursor at
<a href="http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/images/crosshair-cursor.gif">
imagej.nih.gov/ij/images/crosshair-cursor.gif</a>.
<li> Michael Schmid <schmid@iap.tuwien.ac.at> added support for I420, YV12 (a.k.a. IYUV),
NV12 and NV21 formats to the AVI Reader.
<li> The GifWriter now uses ImageIO to save single images.
<li> Thanks to Norbert Vischer, fixed a bug that made it impossible to
select select images with duplicate names from the <i>Window</i> menu.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, added the IJ.d2s(n,significantDigits,maxDigits) method,
which is used by the macro language to convert numbers to strings,
by the <i>Analyze&gt;Histogram</i> command to display values in histogram windows,
and by ImageJ to display values in the status bar as the curser is moved over float images.
<li> Replaced the SocketListener class with Johannes Schindelin's RMI-based OtherListener
class from Fiji, which works on multi-user machines and is more secure.
<li> Thanks to David M. Gauntt, added the FHT(ImageProcessor,boolean)
constructor to the FHT class.
<li> Thanks to Denny Hugg, fixed a bug that caused <i>File&gt;Save As&gt;Gif</i>
to create GIF images that would not work as custom cursors.
