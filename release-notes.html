<li> <u>1.51p 20 June 2017</u>
<ul>
<li>  When adding a hyperstack ROI to the ROI Manager, the channel position
 is set to 0 (display in all channels) if the display mode is "Composite".
 <li> Added the setOption("ConvertToMicrons",boolean) macro function. When this
 option is set, units in TIFF images are converted to microns if the pixel width
 is less than 0.0001 cm.
 <li> Thanks to Norbert vischer, worked around a bug in Java 8 on OS X that
 sometimes caused painting of GenericDialogs to be incomplete.
 <li> Thanks to Rainer Engel, fixed a bug that caused macros that
 passed variables using "&" notation to fail if they used the
 <i>Process&gt;Math&gt;Macro</i> command to process a stack.
 
</ul>
