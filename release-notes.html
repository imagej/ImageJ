<li> <u>1.42m, 10 April 2009</u>
<ul>
<li> When there is no selection, or the shift key is down, the arrow keys can
substitute for "&lt;" and "&gt;" when navigating stacks and hyperstacks.
<li> When previewing point selections, <i>Process&gt;Binary&gt;Find Maxima</i>
does not label the points regardless of the "Label Shift-Click Points" setting.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused FL and FD DICOM VRs to not be correctly decoded.
<li> Norbert Vischer fixed a bug that caused the macro debugger to not work, and error
message line numbers to be invalid, with macros containing multiple line /*...*/ comments. 
<li> Michael Schmid fixed a bug in the public RankFilters.rank() method that caused it
to only process the red channel of RGB images.
<li> Sylvain Mainguy fixed a bug that caused the cursor to change to a
hand at the corners of the bounding box of composite selections.
<li> Fixed a bug in <i>Image&gt;Hyperstacks&gt;Reduce Dimensionality</i> that caused it to not
preserve image labels.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused jar files containing class files with "_" in the
name in subfolders and no plugins.config file (e.g., ImageJ_3D_Viewer.jar)
to generate startup error messages.
<li> Fixed a bug, introduced in 1.42i, that could cause ImageJ to hang when
using the <i>Measure</i> command if "Shape Descriptors" or
"Feret's Diameter" were enabled in <i>Set Measurements</i>.
</ul>
