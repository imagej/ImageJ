<li> <u>1.48i 2 December 2013</u>
<ul>
<li> The "Abort Macro or Plugin" action tool (used by Fiji) is not installed if its
installation would result in no free tool slots.
<li> Thanks to Michael Cammer, fixed a bug that caused the Overlay.setPosition() macro
function to not work as expected with Overlay.drawSting().
<li> Thanks to Davide Heller, fixed a bug in <i>Process&gt;Binary&gt;Skeletonize</i>
that could result in disconnected segments
(<a href="http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/images/skeletonize-bug.png">test image</a>).
<li> Thanks to Pierre, fixed a bug that sometimes caused spline fit segmented lines
to shift 0.5 pixels up and to the left after using <i>Edit&gt;Selection&gt;Interpolate</i>.
<li> Thanks to Jay Unruh, fixed a 1.48h regression that could break Fiji if there were
AutoRun macros.
</ul>
