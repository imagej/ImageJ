<li> TIFF stacks open faster.
<li> Thanks to Ferdinando Pucci, the <i>Image&gt;Stacks&gt;Tools&gt;Concatenate</i>
command works with images that differ in width or height.
<li> The <i>Image&gt;Overlay&gt;To ROI Manager</i> command
starts numbering at 1 instead of 0.

attempts to combine two or more stacks.
