<li> <u>1.39u, 12 March 2008</u>
<ul>
<li> <i>Image&gt;Stacks&gt;Start Animation</i> now works with HyperStacks.

is dragged and dropped on the ImageJ window.
<li> The Gel Analyzer displays an error message if the user clicks
with the wand tool and the shift key is down.
<li> The command recorder now records blank string fields as "key=[]" because
run() option strings containing "key= " are problematic.

calculation on an 8-bit image with a non-rectangular selection larger than ~4 megapixels.
<li> Worked around a bug that could cause a thread deadlock
in macros attempting to open a non-existant file.
