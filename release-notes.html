<li> <u>1.50f 14 December 2015</u>
<ul>
<li> Added the <i>Analyze&gt;Tools&gt;Grid</i> command, which
creates a non-destructive grid of lines, crosses, circles or points on the current image.
<li> Thanks to Michael Elbaum, added the <i>Process&gt;FFT&gt;Make Circular Selection</i>
command.
<li> Thanks to Norbert Vischer, added the Stack.setOrthoViews(x,y,z), 
Stack.getOrthoViewsID() and Stack.stopOrthoViews() macro functions
(<a href="macros/OrthogonalViewsDemo.txt">example</a>).
Thanks to Stein Rorvik, added the getInfo("macro.filepath") macro function.
<li> Thanks to Norbert Vischer, <i>Image&gt;Stacks&gt;Orthoganal Views</i>
is faster and more reliable when working with hyperstacks.
<li> Thanks to Gabriel Landini, added the ImageProcessor.drawLine4(x1,y1,x2,y2)
method, which draws 4-connected lines.
<li> Added the static RoiManager.getRoiManager() method, which returns a
reference to the ROI Manager and opens the "ROI Manager" window if
it is not already open.
<li> Thanks to Nicolas Stifani, fixed bugs that could cause the 
getResultLabel(row) and getResultString("Label",row) macro functions to fail.
<li> Thanks to MartinH, fixed a bug that caused montages created using
<i>Image&gt;Stacks&gt;Make Montage</i> to lose their pixel dimensions.
<li> Thanks to Norbert Vischer, fixed a bug that caused the Pixel 
Inspector tool to not work correctly with blank 32-bit images.
<li> Thanks Kees Straatman, fixed a bug that caused <i>Process&gt;Find Maxima</i>,
with "Count" output, to sometimes display unwanted results.
<li> Thanks to Romain Guiet, fixed a bug in the ROI Manager that caused it
to not use the name of an ROI if the name was 9 character long with a "-" 
in the middle.
<li> Fixed a 1.50c regression that caused the deprecated RoiManager.getROIs() 
method to return null.
