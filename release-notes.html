<li> <u>1.45b 17 February 2011</u>
<ul>
<li> The Memory Monitor <i>Plugins&gt;Utilities&gt;Monitor Memory</i> is improved.
It is larger, it remembers its screen position,
it is no longer an image window, keyboard shortcuts work when it has focus,
and clicking on it runs the garbage collector.
<li> The "Run single instance listener" option in <i>Edit&gt;Options&gt;Misc</i>
is set by default with new Windows installations.
<li> <i>Image&gt;Stacks&gt;Add Slice</i> and <i>Delete Slice</i> work
with composite images.
<li> Fixed a bug that sometimes caused composite images with custom LUTs
to not be saved correctly as TIFFs.
<li> Thanks to Michael Daube, fixed a bug that could cause the FHT.dfht3()
method to throw an exception.
<li> Fixed a bug that sometimes caused the DICOM reader to not correctly
decode the pixel spacing.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, fixed a bug that sometimes caused dynamically
updated messages in GenericDialogs to be truncated.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, fixed a bug that caused <i>Process&gt;FFT&gt;Inverse FFT</i>
to lose the image calibration if the size of the original image was not a power of two.
<li> Fixed a bug that made it impossible to open the Color Picker or Fonts windows if they
were closed using <i>File&gt;Close</i>.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused the scale of profile plots created using wide line selections
on globally calibrated images to be incorrect.
</ul>
