<li> <u>1.42o, 11 May 2009</u>
<ul>
<li> Added  the <i>Image&gt;Stacks&gt;Orthogonal Views</i> command, which is based on
Dimiter Prodanov's
<a href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/plugins/stack-slicer/index.html">StackSlicer</a>
plugin and Albert Codona's Updater class.
<li> Thanks to Julian Cooper, a straight line selection can now be 
rotated about its center by holding down the alt key.
<li> <i>File&gt;Save As&gt;AVI</i> now works correctly with 5D hyperstacks
(e.g., the <i>Mitosis</i> sample image).
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, the
<a href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/source/ij/plugin/filter/EDM.java">EDM algorithm</a>
is more accurate,
there are options for 16-bit and float output, stacks are processed using 
multiple threads, and
<a href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/docs/menus/process.html#voronoi">Voronoi diagrams</a>
 can be generated.
 <li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, <i>Process&gt;Binary&gt;Find Maxima</i>
 works with images>32768 pixels in width or height.
 <li> Gabriel Landini added the "Pad edges when eroding" option to
 <i>Process&gt;Binary&gt;Options</i>.
<li> Added the <i>Mitosis (26MB, 5D Stack)</i> sample image, courtesy of
Eric Griffis and Nico Stuurman.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused images with a width or height greater than 65,535
to not be correctly saved in TIFF format.
<li> Fixed a bug in the File.openAsRawString() macro function that caused it to not
correctly read bytes with values greater than 127.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused an error message to be displayed when a URL
stack download was aborted by pressing 'esc'.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused <i>Process&gt;Filters&gt;Convolve</i> to sometimes
record an extra "\".
<li> Fixed a bug that caused TIFF and RAW virtual stacks greater than 2GB to
not open correctly.
<li> Fixed a bug that could cause the measurent length of rapidly drawn freehand line selections
to be incorrect.
<li> Fixed a bug that could cause the newImage() macro function to display
a bogus "out of memory" error.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused the TIFF reader to not correctly decode
metadata containing non-ASCII characters.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused <i>Image&gt;Color&gt;Merge Channels</i> to throw an
exception of the source images were not all the save type.
