<li> <u>1.51m 23 April 2017</u>
<ul>
<li> Added the <i>Image&gt;Zoom&gt;Maximize</i> command.
<li> Increased the tool button size from 28x28 to 30x30, which
makes the "ImageJ" window 40 pixels wider and 2 pixes taller.
<li> Thanks to Agathe Robisson, added a "Center grid on image"
checkbox to the <i>Analyze&gt;Tools&gt;Grid</i> dialog.
<li> A <i>Plugins&gt;Why are Plugins Missing?</i> command
is added to the <i>Plugins</i> menu if plugins were not loaded
due to macOS 
(<a href="docs/install/osx.html#randomization">Path Randomization</a>).
<li> Added the <i>Help&gt;Examples&gt;JavaScript&gt;TeraByte VirtualStack</i>
example script.
<li> Changed the default extension when saving tables from ".xls" to ".csv"
(coma-delimited values) and added support for opening and saving tables in
 ".tsv" (tab-delimited values) format.
<li> The <i>Macros&gt;Evaluate JavaScript</i> command in the text editor
now respects the "use strict" directive (Java 8 only) to indicate that the code
should be executed in "strict mode". In strict mode, you can not, for example,
use undeclared variables.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, the <i>Analyze&gt;Plot Profile</i>  command
remembers whether the alt key was down (used for verticall plotting) when
initialized so "Live" plots continue to be vertical.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, the AVI Reader tries to recover data from truncated files.
<li> Thanks to Jerome Mutterer, added the setOption("SaveBatchOutput",false)
macro function, which can be used in <i>Process&gt;Batch&gt;Virtual Stack</i>
macros to prevent slices from being written to the output virtual stack.
<li> Thanks to Norbert Vischer, added the Array.rotate() and
Array.getVertexAngles() macro functions and added an optional
edgeMode argument to the Array.findMaxima() function
(<a href="macros/examples/RotateArray.txt">example1</a>, 
<a href="macros/examples/VertexAngles.txt">example2,</a>
<a href="macros/examples/FindMaxima1D.txt">example1</a>).
<li> Added the Roi.hasHyperStackPosition() method.
<li> Thanks to Stefan Helfrich and Mojo Dodo, fixed a bug that caused the
 <i>Image&gt;Color&gt;Arrange Channels</i> command to not
 close the source image in batch mode macros.
 <li> Thanks to Robert Dougherty, fixed a bug that caused the "Overlay"
 checkbox in the <i>Analyze&gt;Tools&gt;Calibration Bar</i> dialog
 box to not be remenbered.
<li> Thanks to Robert Dougherty, fixed a bug that caused the backgrounds
of scrollbars to be white when running on Windows 10 and Java 6.
<li> Thanks to Martin Hohne, fixed a bug that caused the
run("Point Tool...", "...") macro function to not work as expected.
<li> Thanks to Stefan Helfrich, fixed a bug that caused the GroupedZProjector to always
generate a time series regardless of the input stack format.
<li> Thanks to lcsglvr, fixed a bug that caused slow drawing of 16-bit and 32-bit multi-channel
composite color images in "Color" mode.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, fixed a bug in the AVI Reader that caused the file to not be
closed in case of a cancelled dialog or some IO errors.
<li> Thanks to Wilhelm Burger, fixed bugs with the PointIterator on line
and point selections that caused incorrect point coordinates to be returned.
In particular, terminal points of lines were sometimes not returned, 
some consecutive line points had identical positions, and
coordinates of points in point selections were generally off by one pixel.
Also fixed similar problems with the Line.getPixels() method,
</ul>
