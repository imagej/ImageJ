<li> <u>1.51v 27 February 2018</u>
<ul>
<li> Thanks to Norbert Vischer, extended the Plot class to make it
relatively simple to draw the x and y values on plots. For examples, 
refer to <i>Custom Plot Symbols</i> and <i>Bar Charts</i> in
the <i>Help&gt;Examples&gt;Plots menu</i>.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, added the Dialog.addToSameRow()
macro function, which makes the next item added to a GenericDialog
appear on the same row as the previous item
(<a href="macros/DialogDemo2.txt">example</a>).
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, on Linux, the "OK" button in 
GenericDialogs is now on the right, as it is on Macs.
<li> Added a setFontSize() method to the MontageMaker class.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, fixed a bug that caused symbols in plots to be
drawn at the left or bottom border if there was a NaN value.
<li> Thanks to Jerome Mutterer, fixed a 1.51u regression that caused macro calls
similar to newArray(a.length) to always return 1.
<li> Thanks to Rob Lees, fixed a 1.51u regression that caused
the close(pattern) macro function to close the ROI Manager if
'pattern' did not have a wildcard.
<li> Thanks to Norbert Vischer, fixed a 1.51u regression that caused
the close("\\Others") to not work.
</ul>
