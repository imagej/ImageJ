<ul>
<li> ROI enhancements, thanks to Michael Schmid: 
<ul>
<li> Line and point selections have integer coordinates at
pixel centers when displayed at high magnification. Area selections
have integer coordinates at the top-left corner of pixels.
<li> All  interactively created ROIs, except rectangles and ovals, are created
with subpixel resolution when the magnification is above 150%.
<li> Removed the "Sub-pixel resolution" option from the
<i>Edit&gt;Options&gt;Plots</i> dialog.
<li> The <i>Line to Area</i> command is faster and more accurate
<li> The <i>Straighten</i> command is more accurate.
<li> The <i>Image&gt;Info</i> command displays more
information about ROIs.
<li> Long-click to select ROIs from overlays now also works
with lines.
<li> The <i>Measure</i> command uses <i>Line to Area</i> instead of
<i>Straighten</i> to get statistics from segmented and freehand lines
with a width geater than one.
<li> Fixed a bug that could (rarely) cause an exception during
"wipe back" when drawing a polygon or polyline. In "wipe back"
mode, the mouse behaves like an eraser when
moved backwards with alt key down.
</ul>
<li> Thanks to Nicolas De Francesco, added the
<i>Edit&gt;Selection&gt;Fit Rectangle</i> command.
<li> Thanks to 'Dcolam' and Jan Eglinger, the
<i>Edit&gt;Selection&gt;Enlarge</i> command no
longer has a 255 pixel limit. 
<li> Thanks to Peter Bankhead, the default TIFF reader uses the HandleExtraFileTypes
 plugin when it is unable to open a file. As an example, .svs files dragged and dropped
 on the "ImageJ" window are now opened by the Bio-Formats plugin.
<li> Added the <i>Help&gt;Examples&gt;JavaScript&gt;Overlay Text</i> example.
<li> Thanks to Laurent Thomas, added  a 
"Install Keypad Shortcuts" command to the
ROI Menu tool. Add<br>
  call("ij.plugin.MacroInstaller.installFromJar", "/macros/RoiMenuTool.txt+");<br>
to the <i>Edit&gt;Options&gt;Startup</i> dialog
to have the shortcuts automatically installed on startup.
<li> Thanks to Laurent Thomas, the commands in the
ROI Menu tool and the "Group" setting in the ROI Manager's
Properties dialog are recordable.
