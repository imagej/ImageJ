<li> <u>1.45f 13 April 2011</u>
<ul>
<li> Fixed a bug that caused <i>Image&gt;Scale</i> and <i>Image&gt;Adjust&gt;Size</i>
to throw an exception when there was a selection and "Average when downsizing" was
enabled.
<li> If the Rescale Slope tag (0028,1053) exists and has a value<>1.0
then DICOM reader converts to 32-bits and multiples by that value.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, the <i>Mean</i> and <i>Variance</i> filters
no longer propagate NaNs to the end of the line.
<li> Thanks to Simon Roussel, fixed a bug that caused overlays to be lost
when converting stacks to hyperstacks and vis versa.
<li> Thanks to Kris Sheets, fixed a bug that could cause the ROI Manager to not work
as expected on Mac OS X when using the waitForUser() macro function.
<li> Thanks to Norbert Vischer, fixed a bug that caused incorrect centroid, major and minor
results when using <i>Analyze&gt;Measure</i> on thresholded images with
"Fit Ellipse" and "Limit to Threshold" enabled.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused the size of JPEG files to not be 
reduced when re-saving at lower resolution or quality.
</ul>
