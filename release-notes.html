<li> <u>1.48u 9 April 2014</u>
<ul>
<li> Selections added to overlays by the <i>Measure</i> command when "Add to Overlay"
is enabled in <i>Analyze&gt;Set Measurements</i> are labeled with the measurement number.
<li> Thanks to Ted Toal, <i>Image&gt;Zoom&gt;Set</i> sets the zoom center
based on a point selection and it no longer enlarges the window.
<li> Thanks to Norbert Vischer, the macro debugger's 
Array Inspector now flags array value changes.
<li> Added getStringProperty(key) and getNumericProperty(key) methods to the ImagePlus class.
<li> Added a TextWindow constructor that accepts an ArrayList.
<li> Thanks to Johannes Schindelin, added the GenericDialog#isPreviewActive() method.
<li> Thanks to Herbie Gluender, fixed a bug that caused the output of the <i>Plot Profile</i>
and <i>Measure</i> commands to be inconsistent with horizontal or vertical one
pixel wide straight line selections.
<li> Thanks to Gabriel Landini, fixed a bug that could cause the Results table 
to be displayed very slowly on Java 1.7 and 1.8.
<li> Thanks to Burni, fixed a bug that prevented the ImageWindow.setNextLocation() method
from working with windows normally centered on the screen, such as plot windows.
<li> Fixed a v1.48 regression that caused the run("Add Selection...", options) 
macro function to not work as expected with text selections.
<li> Thanks to  Johannes Schindelin, fixed a v1.48r regression that caused the
"Fonts" dialog to be displayed multiple times or incorrectly if you double-clicked
the text tool icon multiple times.
<li> Thanks to Johannes Schindelin, Gabriel Landini and Volker Baecker, fixed a v1.48r
regression on Linux that caused ImageJ to freeze when opening a NonBlockingGenericDialog
such as the text tool or arrow tool options dialogs.
