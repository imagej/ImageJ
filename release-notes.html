<li> <u>1.50c 21 September 2015</u>
<ul>
<li> The <i>Image&gt;Stacks&gt;Make Montage</i> command now
uses "smart recording" (default options are not recorded).
<li> Worked around Java 8 bugs that caused the 't' shortcut
(<i>Edit&gt;Selection&gt;Add to Manager</i>) and ROI Manager arrow
key and mouse wheel scrolling to not work as expected on OS X.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused the "ImageJ" window to expand to full screen
on Windows and Linux when you double clicked on the title bar. 
<li> Thanks to Jens Kriese, fixed a bug that caused no more that 99 menu
entries in a plungins.config file to be loaded.
<li> Thanks to Jochen Reichel, fixed several RGB-related bugs in the Brightness/Contrast dialog.
<li> Thanks to Jan Eglinger, fix a bug that caused the getResultString() macro
function to return "null" on re-opened Results tables if the first column
was non-numeric and all other columns were numeric.
<li> Thanks to Avital Steinberg, fixed a bug that caused the particle analyzer
to alter the Results counter when the "Display results" option was not enabled.
<li> Thanks to John Wolodzko, fixed bugs that prevented ImageJ from correctly
opening .csv and .xls tables with cells containing commas.
<li> Thanks to Linda Fothergill, fixed a bug that caused selections to change
when rotated and then rotated back by the same angle.
