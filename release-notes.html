<li> <u>1.50c 10 September 2015</u>
<ul>
<li> Worked around Java 8 bugs that caused the 't' shortcut
(<i>Edit&gt;Selection&gt;Add to Manager</i>) and ROI Manager arrow
key and mouse wheel scrolling to not work as expected on OS X.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused the "ImageJ" window to expand to full screen
on Windows and Linux when you double clicked on the title bar. 
<li> Thanks to Jens Kriese, fixed a bug that caused no more that 99 menu
entries in a plungins.config file to be loaded.
<li> Thanks to Jochen Reichel, fixed several RGB-related bugs in the Brightness/Contrast dialog.
<li> Thanks to Jan Eglinger, fix a bug that caused the getResultString() macro
function to return "null" on re-opened Results tables if the first column
was non-numeric and it was the only non-numeric column.

</ul>
