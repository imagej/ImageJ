caused it to omit the last column and row of the image.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, fixed bugs in the macro interpreter that caused expressions in
the form s+"abc", where 's' is a string variable, to cause macros to abort when used
as a function argument or used in a 'return' statement.

analyser, when run from a plugin, to display a "No particles were detected..." dialog.
