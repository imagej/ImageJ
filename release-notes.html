<li> <u>1.49r 13 April 2015</u>
<ul>
<li> Thanks to Jerome Mutterer, measurements done using the 
<i>Set Measurements</i> "Limit to threshold" option add two
columns ("MinThr" and "MaxThr") to the Results table.
<li> The <i>Image&gt;Show Info</i> command (press "i" as a shortcut) displays
additional information, including the ImageJ version, java version, OS version,
memory in use and the image size.
<li> The ROI Manager's "Save..." command is faster and displays a progress bar.
<li> Thanks to Norbert Vischer, the macro editor aborts any existing macro
before running or debugging another one.
<li> The <i>Image&gt;Stacks&gt;Plot Z-axis Profile</i> command
now works with line selections.
<li> Thanks to Jan Eglinger, fixed a bug that caused an exception
to be thrown when selecting an image from the Window menu.
<li> Thanks to Daisuke Kinose, fixed a bug that caused GenericDialogs
without "OK" buttons to throw an exception.
<li> Thanks to Norbert Vischer, fixed a bug that caused a pasted image selection
to sometimes become permanent before it can moved.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, fixed a bug that caused the
OpenDialog.setDefaultDirectory() method that caused it to not work as
expected on Windows with file paths that end in slashes instead of backslashes.
<li> Thanks to Jurriaan Holzenspies, fixed a bug that caused an exception to
be thrown when measuring the perimeter of selections created by the
Edit>Selection>Make Rectangular Selection Rounded command in Fiji.
<li> Thanks to Gilles Carpentier, fixed a 1.49q regression that caused
the <i>File&gt;Import&gt;Image Sequence</i> command to ignore
overlays.
<li> Thanks to Vassilis Kehayas, fixed a 1.45 regression that caused the Histogram
command to loss the ability to generate stack histograms of composite color stacks.
