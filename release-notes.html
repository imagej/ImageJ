<li> <u>1.51h 18 October 2016</u>
<ul>
<li> Thanks to Christiane, the Results table, for each point in a multi-point selection,
displays the counter associated with the point and the count for that counter.
<li> A selection in an overlay can be activated by double clicking the corresponding
row in the <i>Image&gt;Overlay&gt;List Elements</i> list.
<li> Thanks to Avital Steinberg, fixed a bug that caused the
ImageProcessor.getStatistics() method to sometimes not work
as expected with ShapeRois.
<li> Thanks to krami79, fixed a bug that could cause an exception
when closing a live plot window.
<li> Thanks to Jan Eglinger, fixed a bug that could cause pugins and scripts
using the GenericDialog.getMessage() method to throw an exception.
<li> Thanks to Norbert Vischer, fixed a bug that caused dots in 
plots to be drawn outside the frame.
<li> Thanks to Ron Paletzki, fixed a bug that caused <i>Image&gt;Scale</i>
and <i>Image&gt;Adjust&gt;Size</i> to not work as expected with
z scale factors less than 0.5 when Interpolation was set to None.
<li> Thanks to Gilles Carpentier, fixed a 1.50i regression that caused
the <i>Edit&gt;Selection&gt;Enlarge</i> command to sometimes not
work as expected when shrinking very small selections.
</ul>
