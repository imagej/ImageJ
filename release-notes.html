<li> <u>1.51v 6 March 2018</u>
<ul>
<li> Thanks to Norbert Vischer, extended the Plot class to make it
relatively simple to draw the x and y values on plots. For examples, 
refer to <i>Custom Plot Symbols</i> and <i>Bar Charts</i> in
the <i>Help&gt;Examples&gt;Plots menu</i>.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, added the Dialog.addToSameRow()
macro function, which makes the next item added to a GenericDialog
appear on the same row as the previous item
(<a href="http://wsr.imagej.net/macros/DialogDemo2.txt">example</a>).
<li> Thanks to Salim Kanoun, added the Overlay.selectable(boolean)
method which can be use to make an overlay non-selectable
(<a href="http://wsr.imagej.net/macros/NonSelectableOverlay.js">example</a>).
<li> Thanks to Salim Kanoun, added the Overlay.setLabelFont(font,true)
method, which causes labels in overlays to scale as the image is zoomed.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, the GenericDialog class automatically 
generates unique labels for macro recording.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, on Linux, the "OK" button in 
GenericDialogs is now on the right, as it is on Macs.
<li> Added a setFontSize() method to the MontageMaker class.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, fixed a bug that caused symbols in plots to be
drawn at the left or bottom border if there was a NaN value.
<li> Thanks to Wilhelm Burger, fixed a bug on Java 9 that caused
<i>Plugin&gty;Compile and Run</i> to not work with .class files
not in the default package.
<li> Thanks to Jerome Mutterer, fixed a 1.51u regression that caused macro calls
similar to newArray(a.length) to always return 1.
<li> Thanks to Rob Lees, fixed a 1.51u regression that caused
the close(pattern) macro function to close the ROI Manager if
'pattern' did not have a wildcard.
<li> Thanks to Norbert Vischer, fixed a 1.51u regression that caused
the close("\\Others") to not work.
<li> Thanks to Rob Lees, fixed a 1.51s regression that caused multi-point
deletion with “Show all” enabled to not function correctly.
</ul>
