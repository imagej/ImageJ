<li> <u>1.50e 11 November 2015</u>
<ul>
<li> Thanks to Curtis Rueden and Brandon Hurr, non-batch mode
macros that process multiple images run much faster.
<li> Thanks to Peter Haub, the <i>Selection Rotator</i> tool, available in
the toolbar's "&gt;&gt;" menu, now rotates about the selection centroid and is recordable.
<li> Added a "Show all" checkbox and a "Help" button to the multi-point
tool options dialog box.
<li> Thanks to John Wolodzko, added the Plot.showValues macro function,
which displays plot window values in the Results table.
<li> Thanks to Peter Haub, added the Roi.getCentroid() method.
<li> Thanks to Jan Eglinger, fixed a bug that caused <i>Image&gt;Adjust&gt;Size</i>, 
when using  bilinear or bicubic interpolation, to shift positions of pixels by 1.0 in X,
0.5 in Y and 0.5 in Z.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, fixed a bug that caused the
<i>Brightness/Contrast</i> adjuster's "Apply" function to not be
undoable for full images or rectangular selections with 8-bit and 16-bit images.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, fixed a bug that caused the
<i>Brightness/Contrast</i> adjuster to hang with RGB images
when there was a non-rectangular selection extending beyond image boundary.
<li> Thanks to Bob Hamilton, fixed bugs that caused the <i>Run to Insertion Point</e>
macro debugger command to fail and the debugger to sometimes behave erratically.
<li> Thanks to David Gault, fixed a potential memory leak by adding a close()
method to the CompositeImage class.
<li> Thanks to Saibal Mitra, fixed a v1.50d regression that caused the
<i>Process&gt;Math&gt;Macro</i> command to not work correctly with 32-bit images.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, fixed a v1.49 regression that caused NaN values to
not be correctly handled in plots.
