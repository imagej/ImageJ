<li> <u>1.49c 6 June 2014</u>
<ul>
<li> Selections added to an overlay by the <i>Measure</i> command are
removed when the correspionding rows in the Results table are cleared.
<li> The <i>Analyze&gt;Label</i> command now displays a dialog box that suggests
using the "Add to manager" option in <i>Analyze&gt;Set Measurements</i>.
<li> Added the setOption("ShowAngle",boolean) macro function, which determines
whether or not "Angle" is reported when measuring straight line lengths.
<li> Thanks to Nicolas Casadei,  fixed a bug that caused macros to not reset the
"escapePressed" flag, which sometimes caused "INTERRUPTED" to be displayed in
the status bar and the macro to not work as expected.
<li> Thanks to Christian Renicke, fixed a bug that caused the <i>Brightness/Contrast</i>
and <i>Color Balance</i> tools to not work as expected on RGB stacks after an
"Apply" operation.
<li> Thanks to Matthew Pearson, fixed a bug in the IJ.renameResults() macro 
function that caused it to sometimes not work as expected if a column
had been add using setResult().

</ul>
