<li> <u>1.45d 16 March 2011</u>
<ul>
<li> Thanks to Tiago Ferreira, the <i>Plugins&gt;Utilities</i> menu is now
more logically organized and the "Do:" drop down menu in the <i>Process&gt;Binary&gt;Options</i>
dialog includes "Outline", "Fill Holes" and "Skeletonize" choices.
<li> Thanks to Tseng Qingzong, the particle analyzer respects the <i>Process&gt;Binary&gt;Options</i>
"Black background" setting when working with non-thresholded 8-bit binary images.
<li> The <i>Image&gt;Duplicate</i> command can duplicate a range 
of channels in C&gt;1, Z=1, T=1 hyperstacks.
<li> Thanks to Frank Sprenger, fixed bugs that caused <i>Image&gt;Color&gt;Split Channels</i> and
<i>Image&gt;Hyperstacks&gt;Reduce Dimensionality</i> to not generate grayscale images when the
input image was in "Grayscale" mode and to sometimes not work correctly in batch mode.
<li> Fixed a bug that could cause the <i>Image&gt;Duplicate</i> command to fail in
non-batch mode macros.
<li> Thanks to Jarek Sacha, fixed bugs that caused the coordinate origin
to be unchanged after <i>Image&gt;Crop</i> and <i>Image&gt;Duplicate</i>.
<li> Thanks to Bill Mohler, fixed a bug that could cause an exception when
working with single channel composite images.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused overlays to not be displayed on stacks opened
using <i>File&gt;Import&gt;TIFF Virtual Stack</i>
</ul>
