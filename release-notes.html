<li> <u>1.51h 1 December 2016</u>
<ul>
<li> Thanks to Johan Doornenbal, the <i>Image&gt;Scale</i> command works
when Width or Height are not given.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, added static ZAxisProfiler.getPlot(ImagePlus) and
ZAxisProfiler.getPlot(ImagePlus,String) methods, where the string argument can
be either "time" or "z-axis".
<li> Added the ImagePlus.getAllStatistics() and ImageProcessor.getAllStatistics()
methods and removed the median calculation done in the getStatistics() methods
in previous versions of ImageJ 1.51.
<li> Added the FolderOpener.open(path,"virtual") method.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, added static getNumParams() methods
to the CurveFitter class.
<li> Thanks to Gabriel Landini, fixed a bug that caused the <i>Image&gt;Duplicate</i>
command to not be correctly recorded with single images when the recorder
was not in "Macro" mode.
<li> Thanks to Gunjan Pandey, fixed a bug that caused plugins that used the
ROI Manager to fail when they were called from batch mode macros. Note
that the ROI Manager is not displayed in batch mode macros unless it is opened
using run("ROI Manager…") prier to entering batch mode.
<li> Thanks to Norbert Vischer, fixed a v1.50 regression that caused the
<i>Edit&gt;Selection&gt;Properties</i> command to not work as expected
with multi-point selections. Use the alt+y shortcut to display
multi-point selection counts.
