<li> <u>1.49k 2 November 2014</u>
<ul>
<li> Thanks to Hermann-Josef Roeser, the <i>Histogram</i> command does a better
job of plotting histograms with more than 256 bins. To get a dialog that allows
you to specify the number of bins, run the Histogram command by pressing alt-h.
<li> The table created by clicking on "List" in histogram windows is now a results table.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, the contrast adjuster no longer disables undo.
<li> On Java 8, ImageJ uses the Rhino JavaScript engine instead
of the built in, but incompatible, Nashorn engine.
<li> Thanks to Christophe Leterrier and Johannes Schindelin, the JavaScript 
interpreter now supports the load() function.
<li> Thanks to Philippe Carl, an ROI selected in the ROI Manager 
is deselected when it is removed from the image.
<li> Thanks to Thomas Templier, the ImageCanvas.setSourceRect() method
now sets the magnification and is more robust
<a href="macros/js/SetSourceRectDemo.js">JavaScript example</a>).
<li> Thanks to Johannes Schindelin, added the ij.macro.Debugger interface.
<li> Thanks to Glen MacDonald, fixed several bugs in the <i>Make Binary</i>
and <i>Convert to Mask</i> commands.
</ul>
