<li> <u>1.50b 17 August 2015</u>
<ul>
<li> Folders and AVI files dropped on the toolbar's "&gt;&gt;" icon open as virtual stacks.
<li> Thanks to Jerome Mutterer, added the <i>Help&gt;Examples&gt;Macro&gt;Grab Viridis Colormap</i>
example macro.
<li> Thanks to Vischer, added the  "Dual Progress Demo" example macro and example JavaScript
to the <i>Help&gt;Examples&gt;</i> menu.
.<li> Thanks to Xiuxia Zhang, the <i>Process&gt;Batch&gt;Convert</i> command
and IJ.openImage(path) method work with text images.
<li> The <i>Image&gt;Overlay&gt;Overlay Options</i> command uses the
'Y' keyboard shortcut and it adds "Show labels" and "Delete" checkboxes to
its dialog box if the current image has an ovelay.
<li> The "Use virtual stack" option in the AVI Reader is set by default. 
<li> Thanks to Jochen Reichel, fixed a bug that caused the
makeSelection("line", xpoints, ypoints) macro function to throw 
an exception if either array contained a non-integer value.
<li> Thanks to Aryeh Weiss, worked around a Java 8 bug that caused the
<i>Memory Monitor</i> to fail.
<li> Thanks to Hermann-Josef Roser, fixed a bug that caused some imported RGB
TIFFs to be read incorrectly.
<li> Thanks to Michael Cammer, fixed a v1.44 regression that caused the setLineWidth()
macro function to sometimes not work as expected if the global line width set in the
<i>Edit&gt;Options&gt;Line Width</i> dialog was not 1.
<li> Thanks to Aryeh Weiss, worked around a Java 8 bug on Macs that sometimes caused
ImageJ to freeze when clicking on "Show All" in the "ROI Manager" dialog.
