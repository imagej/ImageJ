<li> <u>1.49h 1 September 2014</u>
<ul>
<li> Thanks to Jeremy Adler, added "Type" and "Add to overlay" options
to <i>Edit&gt;Options&gt;Point Tool</i> dialog. Note that the 
"Add to overlay" option is not available if the multi-point tool is active.
<li> Thanks to Ilan Tal, single macro tools in the macros/toolsets folder
added to the toolbar using the toolbar's "&gt;&gt;" menu are restored to
the toolbar when ImageJ restarts if the file name matches the tool name
and there is a free toolbar slot.
<li> Thanks to Thomas Siegmund, the RoiManager's getRoisAsArray() method is now synchronized.
<li> Thanks to Pedro Pepe, fixed a bug that caused the "Sum Method" of
<i>Image&gt;Stacks&gt;Z Project</i> to not work correctly with signed 16-bit stacks.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused the makePoint(x,y) macro function to not work correctly with
non-integer coordinates.
</ul>
