<li> Added an "Add to ROI Manager" option to the <i>Edit&gt;Options&gt;Point Tool</i> dialog box.

<li> Added a "Convert to RGB" option to the dialog box that is displayed when a folder

<li> Image window activations are recorded.
<li> Fixed a bug, introduced in 1.41n, that caused <i>Process&gt;Math&gt;NaN Background</i>
to fail with stacks.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused <i>Analyze&gt;Tools&gt;Calibration Bar</i> 
to throw an exception on Windows if the default calibration
bar was taller than the image.

were not all the same size or not all the same type.
