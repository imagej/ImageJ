<li> <u>1.47h 20 December 2012</u>
<ul>
<li> Thanks to Denis Meuthen, you can now create a straight line selection by
defining the start of the line with one click and the end with another click.
<li> Thanks to Curtis Rueden, <i>Image&gt;Stacks&gt;Tools&gt;Make Substack</i>
now works with hyperstacks.
<li> Thanks to Jerome Mutterer, the arrow, brush, pencil and pixel inspector
tools remember the location of their options dialogs.
<li> Thanks to Rainer Engel, the "Log" window remembers its dimensions.
<li> <i>File&gt;Save As&gt;Image Sequence</i> displays a warning if
if the first file in the sequence exists.
<li> The <i>File&gt;New&gt;Hyperstack</i> command can
be invoked by pressing alt-n.
<li> Thanks to Gilles Carpentier, fixed a bug that caused the run("Make Composite") 
macro function to sometimes not work as expected.
<li> Michael Schmid fixed a bug that prevented the AVI Reader from being
able to read AVI files with blank frames into a virtual stack.
<li> Thanks to Alex Hughes, fixed a bug that caused the ROI Manager's Multi Plot
command to disregard the "Vertical profile" option in the
<i>Edit&gt;Options&gt;Profile Plot Options</i> dialog box.
<li> Thanks to Kees Straatman, fixed a bug that caused
<i>Analyze&gt;Tools&gt;Analyze Line Graph</i> to hang
with non-thresholded images.
<li> Thanks to John Oreopoulos, fixed a bug that caused <i>File&gt;Import&gt;Image Sequence</i>
to sometimes not work as expected when all the images in the sequence were not the same type.
<li> Thanks to Jerome Mutterer, fixed a bug that caused an exception when
pasting, in a macro, a non-recangular ROI that is partially outside the target image.
<li> Thanks to Vanessa Bell, fixed a bug that caused the getSelectionCoordinates()
macro function and Roi.getPolygon() method to sometimes unexpectedly return
the bounding rectangle of composite selections.
<li> Thanks to Aivar Grislis, fixed a v1.47g regression that caused the setLocation()
macro function to not work with some windows (e.g., the "B&C" window).
