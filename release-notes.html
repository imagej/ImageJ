<li> <u>1.49o 11 January 2015</u>
<ul>
<li> When opening AVI files, the open() macro function no longer
displays a dialog box. To open an AVI as a virtual stack, use
run("AVI...", "open=file_path use").
<li> The measured values (left column) in the <i>Analyze&gt;Calibrate</i> dialog
are now validated. With 8-bit images, the values must be in the 0-255 range. With
16-bit images, they must be in the 0-65535 range.
<li> Added the IJ.openVirtual(path) method, which opens a TIFF file as a virtual stack.
<li> Thanks to Xavier Colome, added the GenericDialog.addImage(ImagePlus) method.
<li> Added the setDisplayMode(), getDisplayMode() and setActiveChannels()
methods to the ImagePlus class.
<li> Thanks to Neil Fazel, fixed a bug the caused the ROI Manager's
<i>More&gt;&gt;Remove Positions</i> command to sometimes not work as expected.
<li> Thanks to Norbert Vischer, fixed a bug that caused the open() macro function to
fail when downloading .jar files from https servers.
<li> Thanks to Roland Nussbaumer, fixed a bug that caused the "Channels" tool to
not be correctly recorded except in "Macro" mode.
<li> Thanks to Cong-Xin Qiu, fixed bugs in the FileSaver and RoiManager classes
that caused files to not be properly closed when errors occured.
<li> Thanks to William Nicolas, fixed a bug that caused the waitForUser() 
dialog to be closed when the active image was closed.
<li> Thanks to Marius Krause, fixed a bug that caused the
File>Save As>Image Sequence command to not save overlays
when saving in TIFF format.
<li> Thanks to Philip Ershler, fixed a bug that caused the
<i>Image&gt;Stacks&gt;Plot X-axis Profile</i> command, when plotting a
time series stack, to not work if the interframe interval was 0.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, fixed a bug that could result in a confusing
error message when running a plugin and a class is not found.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, fixed a bug that caused updated
"Width" and "Height" fields of the <i>Image&gt;Adjust&gt;Size</i> dialog
to not be rounded.
