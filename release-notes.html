<li> <u>1.44l, 16 December 2010</u>
<ul>
<li> <i>Image&gt;Stacks&gt;Orthogonal Views</i> works with hyperstacks
<li> and can be started/stopped using the shift-h keyboard shortcut.
<li> Thanks to Bob Dougherty, the color bar in histograms is now scaled
to reflect the display range of the image.
<li> Thanks to Michael Doube, voxel depth of imported DICOMs is based 
on the distance between the first and last slices.
<li> Thanks to Michael Schmid, zooming in or out no longer causes the
position to be lost when the cursor is not over the image.
<li> <i>Image&gt;Stacks&gt;Z Project</i> saves the projection method in the preferences file.
<li> Added a "Bare Outlines" option to the particle analyzer.
<li> Thanks to Christian Moll, added the getInfo("log") macro function and the 
IJ.getLog() method.
<li> Added the DicomTools.getTag() method.
<li> Fixed a bug in <i>Image&gt;Stacks&gt;Reslice</i> that caused, when working with
a stright line selection, inconsistent line shifting if "Slice count" was greater than 1 and
"Avoid interpolation" was enabled.
<li> Fixed several bugs in <i>Image&gt;Stacks&gt;Orthogonal Views</i>.
<li> Jan Funke fixed a bug that made it impossible to use the ZProjector
class concurrently.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused <i>Image&gt;Stacks&gt;Make Montage</i>, when used with
signed 16-bit images, to sometimes draw borders using pixel values of -32768.
<li> Fixed a bug that caused <i>Image&gt;Transform&gt;Translate</i> to fill with
white for non-integer bicubic translations.
<li> Thanks to Johannes Schindelen, fixed bugs that sometimes caused <i>Image&gt;Color&gt;Merge Channels</i>
to not work as expected when merging four images or stacks.
